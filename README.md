This is an example of how the ATM exercise should evolve as the trainees start to code their solution

For example, it is expected to have very "spaghetti-like" code or everything within a few couple of classes.

As the trainee (or me, in this case) starts to pick up the pace, while using the knowledge acquired through each step, it is expected to have a better understanding of the problem and a better design

Update:

- As of now, I have added withdraw capabilities. Again, I'm acting as a trainee, reason why this code looks like this
- Right now I'm starting to refactor the code. Somethings have emerged naturally, like stores for accounts and transactions, the transaction class itself and service classes. Again, acting as a trainee
