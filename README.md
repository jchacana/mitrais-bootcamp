This is an example of how the ATM exercise should evolve as the trainees start to code their solution

For example, it is expected to have very "spaghetti-like" code or everything within a few couple of classes.

As the trainee (or me, in this case) starts to pick up the pace, while using the knowledge acquired through each step, it is expected to have a better understanding of the problem and a better design
